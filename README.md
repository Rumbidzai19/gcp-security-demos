# ☁️ GCP Security Demos

This repository contains mini-projects and configurations exploring **security in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**—covering IAM, firewall rules, VPC segmentation, logging, and threat prevention techniques.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- ✅ Understand and apply GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- ✅ Configure secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks
- ✅ Create and manage firewall rules for traffic control
- ✅ Use Cloud Logging and Monitoring to track activity
- ✅ Simulate basic incident detection and prevention scenarios
